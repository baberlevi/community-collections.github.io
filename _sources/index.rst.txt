   :caption: Contents:

Community Collections (CC) is an open-source high-performance computing (HPC) framework which provides a seamless interface between [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Singularity containers](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) so that users can download and deploy software in a Singularity container using the elegant module Lmod system. The CC tool is useful for administrators who wish to install or detect both Lmod and Singularity, customize a list of containers from public sources ([Docker Hub](), and [Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/), and [Syslabs Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)).
